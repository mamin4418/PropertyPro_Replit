PHP Conversion Implementation Plan for Property Management System
Based on the Instructions.md file in the php_conversion folder, I'll develop a comprehensive plan to implement the missing PHP pages and update the database structure as needed.

Overview of Missing Modules
After analyzing the current codebase, I can see several modules that need to be implemented:

Financial Management Module - Expense categories, bank accounts, transaction history
Application and Screening System - Rental applications, screening process
Reporting System - Various property and financial reports
User Management System - User accounts, roles, permissions
Communication System - Messaging and notifications
System Settings - Configuration settings for the application

Development Approach
I'll develop these modules incrementally by:

Creating the database tables first
Implementing the model classes with full CRUD operations
Building the PHP pages with proper form validation
Ensuring security measures (CSRF protection, input sanitization)
Testing each module thoroughly
Updating the installation file to include the new tables
Implementation Strategy
For each component, I'll:

Follow the existing code patterns
Maintain consistent UI/UX
Ensure mobile responsiveness
Add proper input validation
Implement error handling
Add success/error messages
Create navigation links in the sidebar
