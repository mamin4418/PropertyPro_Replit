PHP Conversion Implementation Plan
After conducting a deep analysis of the Instructions.md, Site_Specifications.md, TechSpecs.md files, and comparing them with the current php_conversion folder, I've identified several missing PHP files and functionality that need to be implemented.

1. Missing PHP Files Analysis
Communication System (Priority: Medium)
Missing: pages/communications.php, pages/send_message.php, pages/communication_templates.php, pages/communication_history.php, pages/notifications.php
Status: Partially implemented (send_message.php and communications.php are listed but may need content)
Reporting System (Priority: Medium)
Missing: pages/report_dashboard.php, pages/financial_reports.php, pages/occupancy_reports.php, pages/maintenance_reports.php, pages/create_custom_report.php
Status: Some files exist but likely need implementation
Application and Screening System (Priority: Medium)
Missing: pages/review_application.php, pages/screening.php, pages/application_settings.php
Status: Partially implemented (screening.php exists but may need complete implementation)
System Settings (Priority: Low)
Missing: Some components of pages/settings.php, pages/company_settings.php, pages/theme_settings.php
Status: Files exist but may need complete implementation
User Management System (Priority: High)
Missing: Complete functionality for pages/edit_user.php, pages/permissions.php
